# Docusar Frontend Public

The [Docusar](https://docusar.com) frontend is developed in the private repository
https://github.com/useblocks/docusar-fe.

This public repo exists to track issues for the private repo.
Users can create issues, track progress and see the milestone planning.

This is needed as Github does not feature
[issues-only permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-an-issues-only-repository).
